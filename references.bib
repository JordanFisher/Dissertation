@article{SVDFMM_GimbutasEtAl,
Abstract = {We present a modification of the fast multipole method (FMM) in two dimensions. While previous implementations of the FMM have been designed for harmonic kernels, our algorithm works for a large class of kernels that satisfy fairly general conditions, amounting to the kernel being sufficiently smooth away from the diagonal. Our algorithm approximates appropriately chosen parts of the kernel with "tensor products" of Legendre expansions and uses the singular value decomposition (SVD) to compress the resulting representations. The obtained singular function expansions replace the Taylor and Laurent expansions used in the original FMM. The algorithm requires O(N) operations and is stable and robust. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated with numerical examples. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{SVDFMM_LuisTunon,
Abstract = {The authors present a new matrix compression algorithm to improve the efficiency of the fast multipole method (FMM). The method is based on the application of the singular value decomposition (SVD) to the plane wave FMM aggregation matrices. These matrices are low-ranked, which is exploited to provide alternative sets of orthonormal singular basis functions, obtained as linear combinations of the original basis. By choosing only the most relevant singular functions, a much more compact representation is obtained to accurately handle the interactions between the FMM groups. The new formulation provides a reduction close to one order of magnitude both in computational cost and memory requirements, with a moderate impact on the accuracy of the solution.
